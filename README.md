# spotGEO

## Introduction
spotGEO was a 2020 ESA competition to develop an algorithm that could detect geo-stationary satellites from ground-based telescope images. Depending on parameter settings, 'Main algorithm v2' can achieve an accuracy of 99% in a test dataset of true and false GEO sats, however the kappa score is still low due to poor performance in classifying true GEO sats. To achieve the best results, the localising aspect of the algorithm has to be developed and tested on the dataset of ground-based telescope images.
